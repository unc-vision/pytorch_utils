# PyTorch Utils
A utility library for PyTorch operations

## Package Structure
 * IO (pytorch_utils.io): Contains useful operations for reading and writing images, checkpoints, and model state
 * Viz (pytorch_utils.io): Contains useful visualization functions...
 * Transform (pytorch_utils.transforms): Contains functions for camera and image transforms


## Documentation
 All operations should have docstrings ("""... """) explaining their inputs and outputs and specifying the expected tensor dimensionality, if relevant. These docstrings will be used by the auto-docs generator to provide a more formal library documentation

## Tests
All functions should have an associated unit test.
